    (state_img, state_float):                   represent "state", ubiquitous in reinforcement learning
                                                state_img is a np.array of shape (1, H, W) and dtype np.uint8
                                                state_float is a np.array of shape (config.float_input_dim, ) and dtype np.float32
    (next_state_img, next_state_float):         represent "next_state"
                                                next_state_img is a np.array of shape (1, H, W) and dtype np.uint8
                                                next_state_float is a np.array of shape (config.float_input_dim, ) and dtype np.float32
    (state_potential and next_state_potential)  are floats, used for reward shaping as per Andrew Ng's paper: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/icml99-shaping.pdf
    action                                      is an integer representing the action taken for this transition, mapped to config_files/inputs_list.py
    terminal_actions                            is an integer representing the number of steps between "state" and race finish in the rollout from which this transition was extracted. If the rollout did not finish (ie: early cutoff), then contains 2^31 - 1
    n_steps                                     How many steps were taken between "state" and "next state". Not all transitions contain the same value, as this may depend on exploration policy. Note that in buffer_collate_function, a transition may be reinterpreted as terminal with a lower n_steps, depending on the random horizon that was sampled.
    gammas                                      a numpy array of shape (config.n_steps, ) containing the gamma value if steps = 0, 1, 2, etc...
    rewards                                     a numpy array of shape (config.n_steps, ) containing the reward value if steps = 0, 1, 2, etc...

    The structure of these transitions is unusual. It comes from our "mini-race" logic which will be explained somewhere else. I don't know where yet.
    This is how we are able to define Q-values as "the sum of expected rewards obtained during the next 7 seconds", and how we can optimise with gamma = 1.
